  <h1>Why is ramen delicious?</h1>
  <p>Occasionally a person (usually one of my parents) will ask me why I love ramen <strong>so much</strong>. Usually the person will say,</p><br><blockquote><em>Dad: Isn't ramen just microwave noodles that college kids eat?<br>Me: Well yeah, the instant stuff is still good. But there's </em>even better<em> ramen out there.<br>Dad: How could soup be that much better depending on where you get it?</em></blockquote>
  <h2>Take a Look At This</h2>

  <br>
  <h2>But WHAT is it?</h2>
  <p>My favorite type of ramen is <em>Tonkatsu</em> ramen. You will always find two basic ingredients in Tonkatsu:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Broth made from boiled pork bones</li>
    <li>Ramen noodles</li>
  </ol>
  <p>But that is only the beginning. The broth is made very slowly--it's boiled for at least 24 hours--so that all of the delicious pork fat and marrow can seep out, making the broth rich and delicious. The second part of the fun is the toppings you can put on top of your Tonkatsu ramen:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Marinated braised pork belly (a must for Tonkatsu)</li>
    <li>Creamy-yolked soft-boiled eggs</li>
    <li>Garlic - minced, roasted, in oil, whole cloves</li>
    <li>Green onion (I can never get enough of this stuff)</li>
    <li>Nori - sheets of dried seaweed</li>
    <li>Corn</li>
    <li>Bean sprouts</li>
    <li>Butter</li>
    <li>Bamboo shoots</li>
  </ul>
  <strong>YUM!</strong>
