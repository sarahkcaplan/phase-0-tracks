<!--
What is the purpose of HTML5 semantic tags?
  + To give contextual and semantic meaning to your content. It is especially helpful if someone is using a website page reader because tags clearly organize your content.

Which ones do you see as most useful?
  + <main>, <header>, <footer>, <aside>

What is the order the browser uses to display elements on a page?
  + The browser uses the order you give it. (I think?)

What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge?
  + Snippets are so cool! I am excited to use them to make more boilerplate kind of templates to make coding more efficient.

Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date?
  + Yes, although I'm not sure what they'll be just yet.

What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you?
  + Writing the basic html tags from memory. I had grown too dependent on the autocomplete.

How can you improve your understanding of this concept?
  + I can make an effort to write these tags out by hand until I know them better.
