# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?

  *Version control saves many copies of your work at various points
  so that you can make changes without worry that you'll lose or break
  your code.*

* What is a branch and why would you use one?

  *If your Master branch is the main highway you're traveling to get
  to a destination, a branch is a quick side-road-detour you take along
  the way. In Git you'd use a branch if you'd like to create a new feature
  and keep your in-progress code away from working code, or you'd use a
  branch to experiment with changes without changing your working code.*

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?

  *A commit is a saved snapshot of your code a the time of the commit.
  A good commit message clearly communicates to another developer, or
  your future self, what has changed in the code, why, and any effects
  the change may have any place in the body of code.*

* What is a merge conflict?

  *A line of code (or more) from the local file contradicts the same line
  of code in the remote file.*
